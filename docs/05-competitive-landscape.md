## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** ATS vendors change their upload forms (breaking Playwright tests)  
**Mitigation:** Automated weekly test runs detect breakage, fix within 48 hours

**Risk:** Oracle terminates Always Free tier  
**Mitigation:** Migrate to AWS/Azure (acceptable at $20k+ MRR)

**Risk:** Granite model quality insufficient  
**Mitigation:** Fall back to GPT-4o API (economics still work at $20k MRR)

---

### Market Risks

**Risk:** Low willingness to pay ($29/mo too expensive)  
**Mitigation:** A/B test pricing ($19, $29, $39), offer annual discount

**Risk:** Job seekers prefer free alternatives  
**Mitigation:** Differentiate on accuracy and automation

**Risk:** ATS vendors view us as adversarial  
**Mitigation:** Position as "helping improve parsing quality" (B2B pivot)

---

### Competitive Risks

**Risk:** Jobscan adds automated testing  
**Mitigation:** First-mover advantage, superior infrastructure (lower cost)

**Risk:** ATS vendors add "CV compatibility checker"  
**Mitigation:** Unlikely (conflict of interest to admit parsing failures)

---

## Conclusion: Market Opportunity

**The ATS market is mature ($6-7B) but the CV optimization market is nascent.**

**Key insights:**
1. **79% coverage (15 systems) is optimal** - matches Pareto principle
2. **No existing solution provides automated ATS testing** - white space
3. **Zero marginal cost economics** - can undercut competitors by 40%
4. **Defensible moat** - proprietary test data + infrastructure advantage

**Projected Year 2 ARR: $809k (conservative), $2M (optimistic)**

**This is a viable business, not just a research project.**
